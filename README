# =====================

Welcome to the test branch of Custom-Forms.

The test folder contains a nanoc project with the whole test suite.
If you are a front-end developer and haven't heard about nanoc yet be sure to check it out at http://nanoc.stoneship.org/; it's a very cool and handy tool for generating static HTML files written in Ruby.

You don't need nanoc to run the test suite, just grab the output folder and have fun.

For the tests I'm using QUnit for unit testing (http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit) and Benchmark.js for benchmarking (http://benchmarkjs.com/).
